# Kubevious Frontend 
**Kubevious** brings clarity and safety to Kubernetes. Kubevious renders all configurations relevant to the application in one place. That saves a lot of time from operators, enforcing best practices, eliminating the need for looking up settings and digging within selectors and labels.

**Frontend** is only one of the components required by Kubevious. Learn more about [Kubevious architecture here](https://github.com/kubevious/kubevious/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md).
